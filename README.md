## About

During my college years, we focused on computer networks and data communication. This included studying OSI layer protocols and the architecture behind building the internet. As an electronics engineer, we are responsible for maintaining communication networks, particularly the internet.

## Projects

### Project 1: Basic Switch Configuration
