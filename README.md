## About

During my college years, we focused on computer networks and data communication. This included studying OSI layer protocols and the architecture behind building the internet. As an electronics engineer, we are responsible for maintaining communication networks, particularly the internet.

## Projects

### Project 1.1: Basic Switch Configuration

This activity guides participants in creating a basic network using Ethernet LAN cabling. They'll connect to a Cisco switch via console and remote access, configure essential settings, and verify connectivity with one switch and two hosts using Ethernet and console ports.
